Waiting to be sent to scone mailing list
Hi Authors,

Please reply to this email (with the WG mailing list cced) indicating whether you are aware of any IPR related to draft-thoji-scone-trone-protocol.

If you are aware of any, can you please confirm that all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79 have already been filed?

Thank you.

Cheers,
Qin&Brian
